                <p>Over the last year I have used a number of tools to improve my health after suffering from autoimmune flair ups for the first time in my life. One tool which I found useful was the implementation of a mantra, in which you dervive clarity and guidance from words and their meaning.<br>Mantras have allowed me to consistently reaffirm my "why", improving my motivation towards both short and long term goals. When this falls short, it is discipline that grounds me in consistency.<br>I want to use this experience to work towards developing a daily mantra application where users can use guided adivce to construct their own mantra and receive daily affirmations in line with their customisations and use the app for daily check ins.</p>
